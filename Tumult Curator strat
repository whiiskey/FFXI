ROLES

RUN/DRK: Damage dealer/tank hybrid.  Pulls mobs.  Keep up defensive buffs.  Use One for All during Astral Flow at 74%, 49%, 24%, and 4%.

BLU/RUN: Non-squishy damage dealer.  Keep up defensive buffs.  Use Winds of Promy when needed.
Gives Mighty Guard to party during final form.
The RUN/DRK should be capped on magical haste from Haste II and Honor March, so the haste effect from Mighty Guard isn't needed.
However, the +30 HP regen, 25% defense, and 15 MDT offered by Mighty Guard is useful.
The Random Deals and Wild Cards should reset Diffusion.  Should be able to keep up Might Guard throughout the final form.

GEO: Geo-Frailty and whichever defenseive buff seems best for each mob: Indi-Fade, Inid-Vex, Indi-Wilt.
Not quite sure what to Entrust or when to do it.  Use your judgment.  I'm open to sugges

RDM: Normal stuff.  Haste II, Refresh III, Dia III, Distract III and Frazzle III if they will land.
COR: Offensive buffs for Party 1, defensive buffs for Party 2.
