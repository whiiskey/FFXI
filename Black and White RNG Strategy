HATE CONTROL
The biggest problem with RNG strategy on this fight is hate control.
Do everything possible to manage hate!

GEO/WHM
Keep up haste on the tank.
Erase the tank so the WHM can focus on cures.
Erase song debuffs, especially Massacre Elegy.
Entrust-Haste the Tank so they can spam hate spells.

WHM
Keep cureskin up on the tank as much as possible.
Damage on the tank causes hate loss.  Cureskin prevents damage!

RNG
Use Annihilator for the gun and Coronach for the WS.
Get Enmimty -50 in your midshot and WS sets.  This is the max.
Get enmity -5 in merits for this fight.
Coronach aftermath is enmity -25.
You need -20 in gear.
I can't look at gear right now.  But from memory, possible gear choices include:
Relic head, artifact body, axe/dagger, ennervating earring.

COR
Is there a problem with COR pulling hate?  I don't know, we'll have to find out.

RUN
Reduce damage taken as much as possible.  Make enmity as high as possible.
Get enmity +5 in merits for this fight.
Consider 5/5 Battuta and 5/5 Inspiration.  The Inspiration will give 50% fast cast which will help with spamming hate spells.
I normally do 4/5 Inspiration and 1/5 Rayyke.  But if Rayke is not needed in this fight, might as well 5/5 Inspiration.
Precast set: cap DT and fast cast.  If 4/5 or 5/5 Inspiration, only need 40 or 30 fast cast in gear.
Midcast set for Foil/Flash/etc: cap DT, balance enmity+ and fast cast.
Defense set: For the first mob, have a magic defense focused defense set: capped DT and as much magic defense as possible.
