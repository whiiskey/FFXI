BLACK AND WHITE -- RNG style
People say RNG setup is harder than SMN setup.  I guess I like a challenge.

The two hardest mobs are the first one (Helwige) and the last one (Odin).  The rest aren't bad.

HELMWIGE: SURVIVING THE FIRST MOB
After 5 tries, we got this down.
RNG use Annihilator/Coronach, Decoy Shot.
RUN put lots of effort into good positioning of mobs.
RUN get as much hate as fast as possible.  Minimize magic damage taken in order to minimzie hate loss.
Elemental Sforzo works great for this.  I opened with this and follow up with One for All

ODIN: TRYING TO DIE LESS
Odin loves to go on a death rampage.
Mistake: 
Mistakes: Formalhaut on Odin.  Don't do it.  Use Annihilator/Coronach.

ODIN KO MOVES
KO move #1: Shin Zantetsukin.  Reraise blocks this, but you still take ~1000 magic damage.  20' AOE around Odin.  Stay back 21'+.
KO move #2: Zantetsukin Jin.  A single shadow blocks this.  You don't take any damage.  Conal.  Very narrow cone, very long range.
We have survived KO move #1 but not KO move #2.

SURVIVING ZANTETSUKIN JIN
Odin will use this move after 50%.  On the Verda video it was at 47%.  With us it was also at about 47%.
We see this move on the Verda video at 59:25.  Everyone survived the move.
RUN and GEO used a blink shadow.  RNGs used Utsusemi.  WHM and COR were outside of the cone.
The range is very long, at least 33'.  It might be 40' or 50'.
