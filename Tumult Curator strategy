-- PARTY SET UP
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PARTY 1
RUN/DRK - Raes - Party lead
BLU/RUN - Taki
WHM/SCH - Bzt
GEO     - Tess
COR     - Langly
BRD     - Whiiskey

PARTY 2
RUN/BLU - Falk - Alliance lead
SCH/BLM - Sammeh
RDM     - Gnomie

SWAPPING
COR, BRD, SCH swap parties during Phases 1, 2, 3.
No more party swapping after the Dvergr is pulled.

ALLIANCE SIZE
I want to keep the alliance as small as possible in order to keep the mob HP low.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- JOB ROLES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RUN/DRK: Damage dealer/tank hybrid.
Keep up defensive buffs.  Use a hybrid DD/DT set for TP.
Pull mobs off RUN/BLU one at a time.  Accurate pulls are essential.
Use One for All to help the party survive Astral Flow at 74%, 49%, 24%, and 4%.  Make sure One for All hits all party members.
One for All will need to be reset three times during the fight.
1st reset after 74%, before 49%.  Random Deal is used.  Don't have any JAs on cooldown other than One for All.
2nd reset after 49%, before 24%.  Wild Card is used.  You can use other JAs before Wild Card.
3rd reset after 24%, before 4%.  Random Deal is used again.  Don't have any JAs on cooldown other than One for All.
SP abilities may be useful in emergency situations.
If the fight is going well, pop both SP abilities right before 4% and crush it while other people turtle up.

BLU/RUN: Non-squishy damage dealer.
Keep up defensive buffs.
Use a hybrid DD/DT set for TP.  Good gear choices include Defending Ring, Loricate Torque +1, Dampening Tam, and Staunch +1.
Give Mighty Guard to party during Phase 4.
The RUN/DRK should be capped on magical haste from Haste II and Honor March, so the haste effect from Mighty Guard isn't needed.
However, the +30 HP regen, 25% defense, and 15 Magic Defense Bonus offered by Mighty Guard is useful.
The Random Deals and Wild Card should reset Diffusion.  Should be able to keep up Mighty Guard on the party throughout Phase 4.

GEO: Typical GEO stuff.
Use Geo-Frailty throughout the fight.
Use Indi-Vex during Phases 1, 2, 3.  Switch to Indi-Fade on Gulool Ja Ja just in case Mijin Gakure gets off.
Use Indi-Fade on Phase 4.  That's probaby the best choice for defense against Meteor, Tier VI nukes, and Tier V -ga nukes.
Entrust Indi-Fend during the final form.
Random Deals and Wild Card should reset Entrust.  You should be able to keep up Entrust-Fend throught Phase 4.
Bolster right before Wild Card is used.  Wild Card will be used after 49%.
Idle in DT gear.  Don't idle in Refresh gear.  MP should not be a problem if the BRD keeps up Ballads.

WHM: Typical WHM stuff.
Curaga spam during Bio aura is essential.
Idle in DT gear.  Inyanga +2 set is a great choice for this fight.  All that Magic Defense Bonus!  All that Magic Evasion!
MP should not be a problem if the BRD keeps up Ballads.

COR: Typical COR stuff.
Samauri/Chaos for Party 1.  Swap parties in Phases 1-3 to give RUN/BLU Gallant/Magus.  Light Shot Dia III (of course).
Reset the JA One for All for the RUN/DRK three separate times:
1st reset after 74%.  Use Random Deal.
2nd reset after 49%.  Use Wild Card.
3rd reset after 24%.  Use Random Deal again.
Make sure you have the necessary gear and merits to successfully reset One for All.
Make sure party members are next to you before using Random Deal and Wild Card, especially the RUN/DRK and the BRD.
What's the best subjob?  Consider subbing RUN for defensive traits and JAs.
Feel free to DD if it seems safe, but proceed with caution.  Use a hybrid DD/DT set.  Use your judgment.

BRD: Typical BRD stuff.  Sleep lamps.
Defensive songs for RUN/BLU.  Four Minnes.
Offensive songs for RUN/DRK and BLU.  Honor March, Blade Madrigal, Minuet V, and either Sword Madrigal or Minuet IV.
Ballads for GEO and WHM.  Ballads for RDM and SCH when possible.
Use Soul Voice and Clarion Call at the beginning of Phase 4.  See "BUFFS" section below for more details.
Successfully sleeping all Phase 4 Tumult Lamps with Troubador - Lullaby is essential.
With JAs and today's gear, Horde Lullaby II duration is over 8 minutes.  That may be enough time to kill the Dvergr.
If more than 8 minutes is needed, the SCH needs to Break-ga right before Lullaby wears off, and the BRD needs to re-apply Lullaby.
An accurate and reliable sleep timer is essential.  Use a stopwatch on your phone if you have to.
Reliably equipping the correct gear for Lullaby is essential.  There is no margin for error!

RUN/BLU: Super tank.  Popper.
Be as beefy as possible.
Hold mobs passively.  Just stand there and let them hit you.
SP abilities may be useful in emergency situations.

RDM: Typical RDM stuff.
Main healer for RUN/BLU.
Typical RDM buffs including Haste II, Refresh III.
Typical RDM debuff including Dia III (of course).
I would be interested to know which debuffs land on the mobs.  Magic accuracy is very good now.
Vitiation Gloves +3 give an incredible boost to Gain-MND and Gain-INT to help those debuffs land.

SCH/BLM: Support.  Break-ga lamps.
Backup healer for RUN/BLU.
Elemental seal - Manifestation - Break is essential for re-sleeping Tumult Lamps.
Swap to Party 1 for Accession - Perpetuation - Regen V when its safe.
Swapping to Party 1 is fairly safe during Phases 1, 2, 3.
Do Regen V one final time at the beginning of Phase 4, just before sleeping the Lamps and pulling Tumult Curator.
Regen V with optimal gear should be 11 or 12 minutes.  Hopefully we don't need that much time for Dvergr.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- PULLING THE DVERGR
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

POSITIONING
At the start of Phase 4, the RUN/BLU holds and positions the mobs.  Take the mobs to a good location for sleeping the Lamps.
There needs to be a minimum of 30' between the sleeping Lamps and the Dvergr during the fight.
Also, get the Lamps bunched together as closely as possible.  Favorable positioning of the Lamps is essential because
the AOE range for Horde Lullaby II is tiny!  It's only a 4 yalm radius around the target.

BUFFS
Party 1 gathers together.  BRD drops, SCH swaps in and does Accession - Perpetuation - Regen V.
SCH drops, BRD swaps in and pops Soul Voice and Clarion Call. BRD applies 5 songs to all Party 1 members.
Party 1 separates.  GEO and WHM stand together.  RUN/DRK, BLU, and COR stand together.  BRD pops Ni-Tro.
Ni-Tro doesn't last long, so it's important to move quickly and to not waste time.
BRD gives the mages three Ballads.  That's +60 MP/tick with today's best gear.
Next BRD does Tenuto - Victory March for mages.  Victory March reduces recast timers, speeding up Curaga spam and Finale spam.
Fifth mage song doesn't matter.  It's probably best to skip it and save time.  Ni-Tro doesn't last that long.
WHM does Boost-CHR, making sure to hit the BRD.
BRD moves to the melees for Honor March, Blade Madrigal, Sword Madrigal, Valor Minuet V, and Valor Minuet IV.
BRD sleeps the Lamps.  Make sure to target one of the Lamps in the middle.  Don't target one on the end.
If BRD happens to miss a lamp, quickly sleep it with Foe Lullaby II.
RUN/DRK Flashes boss immediately after Lullaby.
Wait about 10 seconds before moving the mob.  Give RDM and BRD a chance to apply debuffs.  Then move 30' away from the Lamps.
BRD applies Carnage Elegy while Ni-Tro is up.  Try to land Light Threnody II while Ni-Tro is up.
RDM applies Dia III and whatever else can land.
BRD moves away from the party to do Bewitching Etude and Enchanting Etude.
Depending on the BRD's gearsets, Tenuto may or may not be needed to over-write the BRD's existing songs.
Hopefully Ni-Tro is still up so the Soul Voice - CHR Etudes last a long time.
WHM moves away from the BRD and gives Boost-STR to the melees.  Or maybe Boost-DEX.

-- SURVIVAL INFO
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DEFENSE
This fight is about defense.  Stay alive!
Survive the Bio aura!  Survive Astral Flow!  Survive Dread Spikes!
DPS should not be a problem as long as people stay alive.
Have DT sets ready.  Use them thoughout the fight.

SURVIVE THE BIO AURA
The Bio aura is the #1 cause of wipes.
Per BGWiki: Gains a temporary 300/tic Bio aura (30') following Bilgestorm.
Party 1: During Bio aura, everyone gather at the boss.  The WHM will spam Curagas.
Every person in Party 1 needs to get hit by every single Curaga.
Assess the situation and figure out if we should continue damage, slow damage, or halt damage during Bio aura.
It would be great if we could continue damage during the aura, but it might be risky.  We'll have to try it.
Party 2: Run far, far away.  Stay outside of the aura.  Party 2 should stay 30' away from the boss as much as possible.
RDM can run into range to apply buffs and debuffs as needed when the aura is not up.

DON'T LET THE LAMPS WAKE UP
Tumult Lamps are the #2 cause of wipes.
A skilled BRD, a skilled SCH, and good communication are essential.
Hopefully the Bio aura isn't active when the Lamps wake up.  Otherwise the BRD and SCH might die, and the alliance might wipe.
Try to position the boss more than 30' away from the sleeping Lamps.

SURVIVE ASTRAL FLOW
Astral Flow is the #3 cause of wipes.
During Astral Flow, turtle up to the max!  Astral Flow survival set should have capped MDT (26 in gear because Shell V is 24ish)
and as much Magic Defense Bonus and Magic Evasion as possible.  Shadow Ring might be a good choice too.
Don't force Astral Flow if the Bio aura is up.  Don't force Astral Flow if the Lamps are about to wake up.
Party 1: Defensive buffs should up already.  Stoneskin if you can.  Turtle up.  RUN/DRK uses One for All.
Force Astral Flow with damage.  Eat the nukes.  Survive.
Party 2: Run far, far away.  Spread out.  Don't be close to anyone.  The avatars might kill one or two people in Party 2,
but they can't kill everyone if you're spread out.  Make sure Reraise is up.  Turtle up.  Stoneskin up.
Try to eat the nuke and survive.  If you die, get up and re-apply Reraise ASAP.  Use a Reraise item if you have to.
Re-buff ASAP.  The next Astral Flow is moments away.  Get ready.
One for All from the RUN/BLU can help Party 2 survive one of the Astral Flows.
It would probably be best to use the RUN/BLU's One for All on the first Astral Flow.
Special note about All for One: The potency is based on each individual player's maximum HP.  Each person should consider
making a special high-HP DT set.  Swap into this defense set right before the RUN hits you with All for One.

SURVIVE DREAD SPIKES
The Dvergr can use Dread Spikes, and this is the #4 cause of wipes.
Watch out for this.  This is a hazzard to the melees, especially the BLU.
If the mob puts up Dread Spikes, stop damage and turn.  Try to dispel the effect.
BGWiki reports that this effect is very difficult to dispel.  Finale worked only with Elemental seal or Troubadour.
We have very good magic accuracy gear now.  I'd like to try to dispel it without using JAs.  
I'd like to try Finale with maximum magic accuracy gear, Soul Voice - CHR etdues, Boost-CHR, and a Marine Stewpot.
Hopefully BRD was able to land Light Threnody II previously when Troubadour was up.
If that doesn't work, we can re-try with Indi-Focus and Geo-Languor.
If that doesn't work, I suppose we could use Troubadour.  Or BRD could sub BLM and use Elemental Seal.
Marcto may be useful too since it gives Finale 50% magic accuracy bonus.
We could try COR's Dark Shot, or BLU's Blank Gaze, but I don't expect those to land.
We could also try RDM's Dispel.  I wouldn't expect Dispel to land on a dark-based boss like Dvergr, but it's worth a try.
RDM has a lot of magic accuracy gear now too.  Stymie - Dispel may land, and this could be tried as a last resort.

SURVIVE PHASES 1, 2, 3
The Chariots, Beastmen Kings, and ToAU HNMs all have nasty TP moves, but they're not THAT bad compared to the Dvergr.
Be smart and safe during the first three phases.  Protect yourself.  Use the right barspells, runes, and buffs.
Stand in the right place for the HNMs.  Not at the head, not at the tail.  The front leg seems to be the best place.

ITEMS
Everyone needs to have Echo Drops, Remedies, and Reraise items.
Items like Reraiser, Hi-Reraiser, and Super Reraiser, are better than equipment like Reraise Earring and Reraise Hairpin.
The equipment takes too long to use.  Have the instant use items in your inevntory and use them if needed.
Vile Elixir and Vile Elixir +1 are good for emergency situations.
