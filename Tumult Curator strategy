SWAPPING

SCH can quickly swap to Party 1 for Regen V if it's safe.
RDM, GEO, WHM, BLU don't swap.


ROLES

RUN/DRK: Damage dealer/tank hybrid.
Pull mobs off RUN/BLU one at a time.  Keep up defensive buffs.  Use a hybrid DD/DT set.
Use One for All during Astral Flow at 74%, 49%, 24%, and 4%.
One for All will need to be reset three times during the fight.
Try not to use too many JAs so One for All actually gets reset.

BLU/RUN: Non-squishy damage dealer.
Keep up defensive buffs.
Use a hybrid DD/DT set that includes Defending Ring, Loricate Torque +1, Dampening Tam, and Staunch +1.
Set Winds of Promy and use if needed.
Give Mighty Guard to party during final form.
The RUN/DRK should be capped on magical haste from Haste II and Honor March, so the haste effect from Mighty Guard isn't needed.
However, the +30 HP regen, 25% defense, and 15 MDT offered by Mighty Guard is useful.
The Random Deals and Wild Cards should reset Diffusion.  Should be able to keep up Mighty Guard throughout the final form.

GEO: Typical GEO stuff.
Geo-Frailty for most of the fight.  During the 4 Astral Flows, switch from Geo-Frailty to Geo-Fend.
Use a defensive Indi spell.  Indi-Fade seems best for me.
Indi-Vex isn't that potent anymore, so Fade is probably better than Vex.
The magical attacks are worse than the physical attacks, so Fade is better than Wilt.
Not quite sure what to Entrust or when to do it.  Might not be necessary.  Use your judgment.  I'm open to suggestions.

WHM: Typical WHM stuff.
Curaga spam during Bio aura is essential.  

COR: Typical COR stuff.
Offensive rolls for Party 1.  Samauri/Chaos seems good.
Swaps parties to give RUN/BLU defensive rolls.  Gallant/Magus seems good.
Party swaps should no longer be needed during final form.
Reset the JA One for All for the RUN/DRK three separate times:
1st time between 74% and 49%.  Use Random Deal.
2nd time between 49% and 24%.  Use Wild Card.
3rd time bteween 24% and 4%.  Use Random Deal again.
Make sure you have the necessary gear and merits to successfully reset One for All.
The BRD will need Nightingale and Troubadour reset during the fight.
Make sure BRD is in the party and next to you before using Random Deal and Wild Card.
Perhaps GEO can Bolster and BRD can Soul Voice and Nitro before Wild Card.  We might get lucky.
Light Shot Dia III of course.
CORs don't have much magic defense.  Consider subbing WHM, RDM, or RUN.  This gives you magic defense bonus and stoneskin.
Feel free to DD if it seems safe, but proceed with caution.  Use a hybrid DD/DT set.
It may be better to not DD, stay in DT set, and stay alive.  Use your judgment.

RUN/BLU: Super tank.
Be as beefy as possible.

RDM: Typical RDM stuff.
Main healer for RUN/BLU.
Typical RDM buffs including Haste II, Refresh III.
Typical RDM debuffs.  Dia III is a given.
I would be interested to know how well the other debuffs land on the different mobs.

SCH/BLM: Support.  Break-ga lamps.
Backup healer for RUN/BLU.
Elemental seal - Manifestation - Break is essential for re-sleeping Tumult Lamps.
SCH can quickly swap to Party 1 for Accession - Perpetuation - Regen V if it's safe.
I suppose the SCH could also Accession - Perpetuation - Embrava towards the end of the fight if it's safe.
