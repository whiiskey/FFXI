SWAPPING
Support jobs will swap parties for buffs.
Leaders have auto-invite set up to facilitate swapping.
COR and BRD should be swapping.
RDM could possibly swap for Refresh III on RUN/DRK and GEO.  BLU shouldn't need refresh with Tizona.  WHM might prefer Sublimation over refresh.
SCH could possibly swap for Regen V and Embrava.
GEO, WHM, BLU don't swap.


ROLES

RUN/DRK: Damage dealer/tank hybrid.
Pulls mobs off RUN/BLU one at a time.  Keep up defensive buffs.
Use One for All during Astral Flow at 74%, 49%, 24%, and 4%.

BLU/RUN: Non-squishy damage dealer.
Keep up defensive buffs.  Set Winds of Promy and use when needed.
Gives Mighty Guard to party during final form.
The RUN/DRK should be capped on magical haste from Haste II and Honor March, so the haste effect from Mighty Guard isn't needed.
However, the +30 HP regen, 25% defense, and 15 MDT offered by Mighty Guard is useful.
The Random Deals and Wild Cards should reset Diffusion.  Should be able to keep up Mighty Guard throughout the final form.

GEO: Geo-Frailty for most of the fight.  During Astral Flow, switch from Geo-Frailty to Geo-Fend.
Use a defensive Indi spell.  Indi-Fade seems best for me.
Indi-Vex isn't that potent anymore, so Fade is probably better than Vex.
The mob's magical attacks are worse than the physical ttacks, so Fade is probably better than Wilt.
Not quite sure what to Entrust or when to do it.  Might not be necessary.  Use your judgment.  I'm open to suggestions.

WHM: Normal WHM stuff.
Curaga spam during Bio aura is essential.  

COR: 

RDM: Normal RDM stuff.  Haste II, Refresh III, Dia III, Distract III and Frazzle III if they will land.
COR: Offensive buffs for Party 1, defensive buffs for Party 2.



Have a DT set.  Use it thoughout the fight, especially on Astral Flow.
Use stonkeskin.  MDT,
