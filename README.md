# GearSwap
Collection of lua files for GearSwap.

I'm not a programmer.

I've spent a fair about of time on the BLM, RUN, and BRD luas.  There's some original stuff there.

I wouldn't call any of them finalized.  They're all a work in progress.

It would be nice if I could clean them all up, make them nice and organized, but that's prob not gonna happen.  This is prob as good as it's gonna get.

Thanks for visiting
